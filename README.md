**Generative AI Chatbot**

This project is a generative AI chatbot powered by Cohere’s LLM API. It allows users to ask both general questions and document-specific queries.

**Key Features:**

•	Document-Specific Queries: Upload a file, and the chatbot breaks down the content into chunks, vectorizes them, and stores them in a vector database. This enables precise, 
  document-based query responses.
	
•	Transparent Answers: The chatbot references the relevant documents in its responses, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.

•	Document Management: A feature is implemented that allows the manager of the vector store to store, delete, and re-upload documents, maintaining an efficient vector store for accurate query 		handling.

•	Seamless Integration: This project integrates natural language processing with document handling using LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

By combining LLM capabilities with efficient document handling, this project demonstrates the power of AI in delivering accurate and context-aware information.
